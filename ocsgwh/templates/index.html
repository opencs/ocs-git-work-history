<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
    This is the report for the Git repository <code>{{repository_dir}}</code> generated by
    <strong>OpenCS Git Work History</strong> at {{report_date}} from the directory {{repository_dir}}.
    It uses all commits from the repository to estimate the total effort spent by the team in it.
</p>

<p>
    The measurements are estimated in lines of code added and removed ans well as the number
    of commits performed by the team as a whole and also for each author found in the repository.
    As such, it is not a precise tool to verify the amount of work done but can te used by a human
    to evalute the work and compare repositories and teams.
</p>
